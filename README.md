# automated-classification-of-medical-research-abstracts-by-medical-condition

### Overview
This project aims to automate the classification of medical research abstracts by their associated medical conditions. The goal is to create a model that can accurately categorize abstracts, which would help streamline literature review processes in medical research.

### Motivation
Medical research is advancing rapidly, producing a massive volume of literature across numerous medical conditions, diseases, and treatments. For researchers and practitioners, manually sorting through abstracts to find studies relevant to specific medical conditions is time-consuming and labor-intensive, often resulting in valuable insights being overlooked. This project addresses this problem by developing an automated classification model that categorizes medical research abstracts according to medical conditions.

Automating this process has several critical benefits:

- **Enhanced Research Efficiency:** Researchers and clinicians can quickly identify relevant studies within their field, reducing time spent on manual search and review.
- **Improved Access to Knowledge:** Automated categorization can help surface research findings that may otherwise remain hidden, supporting a broader understanding of complex medical conditions.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** By categorizing and organizing abstracts, this project could assist healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers in identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities in medical research more effectively.

The ultimate goal of this project is to build a scalable, reliable system that can keep pace with the growing body of medical literature and contribute to advancements in medical knowledge dissemination and healthcare practices.
